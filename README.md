<strong>Bugs!</strong> is a graphical ant simulation and programming competition platform. In the simulation, colonies give birth to ants who wander around, forage for food, battle with competitor ants and grasshoppers, emit pheromones for navigation and avoid deadly poison. I developed this simulation in C++ as a course project using objected-oriented programming and polymorphism.
